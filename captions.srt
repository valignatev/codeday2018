1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,680
Hi everybody!

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Valentin is my name

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,540
I'm a programmer like every speaker here

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,420
Programmer means write code for money

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,940
Well, not exactly

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
And not always

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,820
Who can tell right now what is programming for?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,000
*(crowd) make life easier

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,320
what-what?

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,740
Make life easier, anybody else?

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,840
*(crowd) make sites

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,420
Aha

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,380
*(crowd) make money, write soft

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,560
All correct, all correct

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,540
*(crowd) to not go out and make money

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,700
Plain amazing, yeah

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,260
Well, all of you are right

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,580
Programming indeed makes life easier

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,660
Programming is fun

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,220
It is easy

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,200
with a fine print

22
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,160
Actually, easier than you think right now

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Won't talk long

24
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,420
About my story

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,860
Sad story of my life

26
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,360
Let me show you something

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,560
Supposedly funny

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,700
Programming indeed makes life easier

29
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,900
Aaand with it's help you can

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,520
Do something really fast

31
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,880
And very helpful

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,940
Who know what imdb is?

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,220
*(crowd) It's ratings

35
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,000
It's movies database like kinopoisk but in English
*(kinopoisk is Russian imdb)

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,680
Big one, imdb.com

37
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,580
And they dump all info to the text files on their site which can be downloaded

38
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,560
Huge file with the size of 0.5GB

39
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,000
With all titles, release dates

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
And ratings, most interesting

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,700
So

42
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Let's write a program

43
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,220
Which will help to pick something new to watch

44
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,620
To begin, everybody is able to see? Shoud I make it bigger?

45
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,460
*(crowd) Bigger is better

46
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,680
Bigger like this, is it better?

47
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,620
*(crowd) A little more please

48
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Yes, sure, sure, anything

49
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,540
Like this

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,100
Aha

51
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,300
So, two files

52
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,060
From imdb are interesting for us

53
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
And this is how looks one of them

54
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,620
Pay attention

55
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,100
Columns at the top

56
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you all know about Excel?

57
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,160
This is an Excel file in a nutshell, but raw

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,820
Every column

59
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,600
Is separated from each other with a tab symbol

60
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,500
Here, at the top

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,740
Headers

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What do we have, a title

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,460
is for adults or no

64
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,640
release date

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,020
Genres

66
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,320
And then the rows

67
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,320
First movie, second movie, third movie

68
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,240
Fourth movie, fifth etc

69
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,400
And the second file

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
Where the first column is

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,520
First column is the same as in first file

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,860
And the second column is a rating on the site

73
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,860
It's the same one as in kinopoisk

74
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,640
Everybody know what kinopoisk is?

75
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
So, this is the same as kinopoisk rating

76
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,880
And the number of votes

77
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,220
To know if anybody is interested in the movie

78
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,420
What do we do with them

79
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,280
We'll take both of these files

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,580
And we'll try to merge them

81
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,560
By the first column to get whole pucture of all ratings

82
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,140
First, pay attention to te botton

83
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Where's the mouse, here, this number

84
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,740
This is an amount of imdb movies with any rating

85
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
820202

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,480
I'll write simple Python programm, nevermind if you don't understand something

87
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,740
The purpose is to show you that it's easy and fun

88
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,340
Supposedly

89
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,780
Aaaam

90
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
And we'll start with

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
The use of one of the Python's libraries

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,740
Which helps

93
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,280
To read files in such format in convenient way

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,820
Second, we have to open these files

95
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,700
In Python we open files with "open" function

96
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,280
Is here anybody who never wrote any code?

97
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,320
Everybody wrote something, like with Pascal in school, right?

98
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,560
Good, great

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,440
I'll show you now

100
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,820
*(mumbling) hippie-expand

101
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,040
Well

102
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,620
Yes

103
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
We open the file in "read mode"

104
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,780
Call it "f1"

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,180
And put file contents in the variable

106
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,700
Which we call "title"

107
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
For this we wrap it into the thing we just imported

108
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,960
Pass the file there

109
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Aaand

110
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,740
The "delimiter" param which means that

111
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,520
backwards slash means tab symbol, it's represented that way

112
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,740
Each column is separated by the tab symbol

113
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,560
And while first file is opened, we open the second one

114
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,540
Aaa, which is called "ratings"

115
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,020
It's opened in the "read" mode as well, read, the read

116
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
And we put its contents

117
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,700
in the

118
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
variable called "rating"

119
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,360
"f2"

120
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,500
delimiter is equals

121
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,080
the tab symbol as well

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Remember what's next?

123
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,140
We take the ratings file

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,340
We begin to go through each line and try to merge it with a row from the first file

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,560
Problem is - the first file is much bigger than the second one

126
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,100
It's about 5 million lines because not every movie has a rating

127
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,360
That's why

128
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,640
Everybody is familiar with a loop concept?

129
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,340
Yes? Good

130
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,140
This is a loop

131
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Over each row from the ratings file

132
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,700
So, we take

133
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,600
The row from ratings file

134
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,020
Then take the row from the file with

135
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,860
the titles, the names

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,300
While

137
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,140
Aaa

138
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,920
The first column which is called "tconst"

139
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,180
is not equal to the same row

140
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
from the ratings file

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,780
We take the next

142
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,940
Row from the big file

143
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,780
You get what's happening, right?

144
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
And when they match

145
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,640
When they match we break out of while

146
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,020
By the way you see that I insert 4 spaces before each line?

147
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,420
It's just like begin/end in the Pascal in a nutshell

148
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,040
Beginning and the end of the block

149
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,240
I think, never wrote anything in Pascal to be honest

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,300
Ahahah

151
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,600
When they mached

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,780
We, uhh

153
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,860
Let's create an empty variable which we'll call "movies"

154
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,520
"Movies"

155
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,020
It's just a list which we'll fill with

156
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,600
movies in convenient format

157
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,560
And Python list has an "append" function

158
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,500
In which we'll put it in a convenient way

159
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,280
Aaa, movies has a title which we get from the big file

160
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
Aaaa, I think it's name is

161
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,020
It's name is "primaryTitle", yeah

162
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,260
Primary Title

163
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,140
*(savage English) Pri-ma-ry

164
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,420
Title

165
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Release year

166
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Which is called "start"

167
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
"Year"

168
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,860
Next we have genres

169
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Which called "genres"

170
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,560
And the "rating" in which we're interested

171
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,080
We take rating from the small file, by which we

172
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,740
By which we go through

173
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,720
It's called

174
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,020
average rating

175
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,260
But we need it in the number format

176
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,960
Who knows the difference between int and float?

177
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,140
Int is a whole number, float is a number with a dot, with a comma

178
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,940
Like this, a fractional number

179
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Aand, we need a number of votes

180
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,040
Which we also take from the small file

181
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,940
But we cast it to the int number

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
And its name is

183
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Its name is "numVotes"

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,160
Let's cross our fingers and try to run it

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,700
I opened to the near

186
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,640
The console of the Python language

187
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,380
In which we will play

188
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,760
Run something

189
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,480
Everything is wrong because I mistyped semicolon and a colon

190
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
Let's try one more time

191
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,940
It seems that something is working there

192
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
We should get

193
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,180
820

194
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,020
movies

195
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,540
here

196
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,860
While it's counting, files are huge, let's talk about

197
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,760
Socializing

198
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,700
The biggest mistake beginner programmer could make

199
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,160
Is a lock in the mum's basement only with books and speak to nobody

200
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,460
That's why socialization is very important

201
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,440
Without it you'll lose the interest in what you're doing really fast

202
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,060
Main question which should bother you

203
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,740
Is where to go after this conferens

204
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,300
Where to hang out?

205
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,080
Remember first link, it's a

206
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
Telegram group

207
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Who doesn't have Telegram - install it

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,260
*(crowd) Untill it's not blocked yet

209
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes, untill it's not blocked yet

210
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
And start from there

211
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,620
Second link is a StackOverflow site

212
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,080
There you can ask your questions

213
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,240
It has a Russian version, English is not required

214
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,480
And Discord

215
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
It's for gamers, but there are programmers as well

216
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,460
And slack.com

217
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,740
It has a lot of communities as well

218
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
It's main starting points

219
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Where to learn programming?

220
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,120
Probably, you started to suspect on your computer classes that

221
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,940
Your teachers

222
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,100
Have not the most up to date knowledge

223
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,060
Did anybody noticed it?

224
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,120
Yeah, yeah, good

225
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,580
So, the best

226
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,560
Learging source is the Internet

227
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,460
In particular

228
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Sites, blogs

229
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Educational videos etc

230
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,800
And local meetups just like this one

231
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,380
While we're chit-chatting here

232
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,160
There is something interesting over there

233
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,120
Yup

234
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,560
And the main thing is when you write code - don't keep it within

235
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,740
You need it to

236
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,960
Show it to everybody

237
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,120
Who has an Instagram?

238
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Why nobody has it?

239
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,260
Well, github.com

240
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,720
is an Instagram for programmers

241
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,580
Where we show not our suntanned bodies but our code

242
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,640
Here

243
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,300
Let's check how it's going

244
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,720
Oh, look, 820200 movies

245
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,600
Just about like it's in the ratings file

246
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Let's play with them a little bit

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,440
So, Python has a module which is called "random"

248
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,260
It's to work with random things

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
So, let's look

250
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
For random

251
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,780
"choice" which is choice in English

252
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,480
Some random movie

253
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Ahhh

254
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Don't concentrate to much on this one

255
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,420
Movie among the movies

256
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,340
if

257
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,660
Its rating

258
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,720
Ra-ting

259
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,340
Yeah, bigger...

260
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,880
Let's take 8.5

261
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
And

262
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
And, for example, votes are

263
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,080
more that 10000

264
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
We don't want some unknown

265
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,400
shit to wach

266
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,800
And

267
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,160
And let's say it should be science fiction

268
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,800
Sci-Fi

269
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,220
Among its

270
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,300
Genres

271
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Aha, what it suggests us to watch?

272
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,140
It suggest us "Inception" from 2010

273
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,180
Let's look for something else

274
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
*(savage English)"Mystery Science Theater 3000"

275
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Anybody saw this?

276
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,660
Ahahah

277
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,520
Aaaa, ha-ha-ha

278
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,200
Let's for example

279
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,320
year, right?

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,460
Is more than 2010

281
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Here's something fresher, right?

282
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,820
Hated in the Nation, [then same but in Russian]

283
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Let's for example

284
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,240
Check out some "Action" movie

285
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,100
Vikings from 2013

286
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,760
It's alright

287
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,320
Or Mass Effect 3, it seems that imdb has games as well

288
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,940
So, programm is working

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And, note that

290
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,620
If I, of course,

291
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,000
Can type today

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,740
Please

293
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
The whole program takes

294
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,520
20 lines of code

295
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,480
21 including all these things, and if we cut them

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
19, 18 lines of code

297
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,860
Just with 18 lines of code we wrote something helpful

298
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,720
Which you can even use

299
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,540
So, it was my talk purpose

300
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,580
You don't have to think that programming is hard

301
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,960
It's hard of course, but not when you just starting

302
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,120
All I just wrote and these slides are on github

303
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
As I said, in the Instagram for programmers

304
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,680
Leave a like :)

305
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,180
I also insist

306
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
on you to register there

307
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,160
And start to share your code even if it's just hello world

308
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,540
Or some unfinished drafts

309
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,520
Upload, share, nothing wrong about it

310
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,080
It's like shot your food and upload it to the Instagram

311
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
My twitter nickname

312
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,060
And in

313
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,340
Telegram

314
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,580
And in GitHub

315
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,160
Look for me, write me

316
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,300
Don't hesitate

317
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,780
Aa, that's all my slides, I'll open "where to hang out" slide just in case

318
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,400
So you write it down

319
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
That's all I have, I tried to make it fast

320
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,460
Ask your questions if you have any

321
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,400
I hope some of you is interested in trying things out

322
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,520
After all of this

323
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
After all of it

324
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,920
*(crowd) make adults!

325
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,420
Whaaa?

326
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,280
*(crowd)is adults!

327
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,160
Wat?

328
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,620
*(crowd) adult movies!

329
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,560
Oohh, adult movies

330
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,380
Let's check them out, we have time

331
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,320
Ha-ha

332
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,340
So

333
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,400
I didn't copy it

334
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Let's copy it, why not, on the go

335
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,020
For adults

336
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,740
he-he

337
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,080
Uuumm

338
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,820
Here

339
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,580
Here we'll open our Pythony

340
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,500
Now it'll

341
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,080
It'll calculate

342
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,780
I wonder if imbd has adult movies ratings

343
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
I think it's any 18+ movies

344
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
So, let's check, right?

345
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,540
Uuumm

346
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,540
We'll cut the year

347
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,680
And instead

348
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Rigth? Adult movies

349
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,700
Aaand, I forgot to close it

350
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,520
RIght?

351
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,580
Hey, stop

352
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,380
It turns out that there is no

353
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,100
for ad... Let's do it this way

354
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,620
Aha

355
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,020
"Cannot choose from an empty sequence"

356
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,360
It seems that there is nothing with this rating among adult movies

357
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Let's better

358
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Cut 10000 votes

359
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,400
Oh!

360
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Kill Thrill from 2006

361
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,280
Some drama

362
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,400
Let's look for something else

363
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
Write them down, yeah, ha-ha-ha

364
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,160
That's it?

365
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,400
Laura

366
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,360
Crotch

367
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,400
Tomb Raider

368
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,540
*(crowd)he-he-he-he

369
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,360
Ok, that's enough, ha-ha-ha

370
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,060
So, that's it

371
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
That's all I have, he-he

372
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Ask your questions if you have any
